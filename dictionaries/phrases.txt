A picture is worth a thousand words
Break the ice
Once in a blue moon
Piece of cake
Speak of the devil
Time is money
Under the weather
Hit the nail on the head
Let the cat out of the bag
Birds of a feather flock together
When pigs fly
The ball is in your court
The best of both worlds
Bite the bullet
Burn the midnight oil
Call it a day
Cut to the chase
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fit as a fiddle
Go the extra mile
